## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete employee records.
- **Validation**: Input validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for robust API responses.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing employee data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
